# Job Application Tracker

A MERN-based application designed to help users track and manage their job applications.

## Overview

This project was developed based on the MERN course by John Smilga on Udemy. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to record and keep track of their job applications.

### MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based framework used for building robust and scalable web applications. It consists of four key technologies:

- **MongoDB:** A document-oriented NoSQL database that efficiently stores data in JSON-like documents, providing flexibility and scalability for handling large volumes of data.

- **Express.js:** A lightweight web application framework that runs on Node.js, simplifying server-side logic and facilitating efficient communication between the front-end and back-end components.

- **React:** A front-end JavaScript library used for crafting user interfaces, enabling efficient rendering and component reusability.

- **Node.js:** A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side, coordinating communication between front-end and back-end components
